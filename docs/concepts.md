# Concepts

## Plugin Types

HPM defines five plugin types as string-valued enum members.

```python
class HiveMindPluginTypes(str, enum.Enum):
    DATABASE         = "hivemind.database"
    NETWORK_PROTOCOL = "hivemind.network.protocol"
    AGENT_PROTOCOL   = "hivemind.agent.protocol"
    BINARY_PROTOCOL  = "hivemind.binary.protocol"
    POLICY           = "hivemind.policy"
```

Source: `hivemind_plugin_manager/__init__.py:13`

Each value is the setuptools entry-point group name that plugin packages must use.

---

## Entry Points

Plugins are ordinary Python packages. The only contract with HPM is a single line in the
package's `setup.py` (or `pyproject.toml`):

```ini
# pyproject.toml
[project.entry-points."hivemind.database"]
hivemind-json-db-plugin = "json_database.hpm:JsonDB"
```

or in `setup.py`:

```python
entry_points={
    "hivemind.database": [
        "hivemind-json-db-plugin = json_database.hpm:JsonDB"
    ]
}
```

The left-hand side of the `=` is the **plugin name** — the string callers pass to factories.
The right-hand side is the dotted import path to the class.

HPM itself does not ship any plugin implementation. It only defines the abstractions and
discovers whatever packages are installed in the current Python environment.

---

## Discovery: `find_plugins()`

```python
def find_plugins(plug_type: HiveMindPluginTypes = None) -> dict:
```

Source: `hivemind_plugin_manager/__init__.py:108`

`find_plugins` calls `_iter_entrypoints` (`__init__.py:92`) which tries
`importlib_metadata.entry_points` first and falls back to `pkg_resources` if
`importlib_metadata` is not available.

Return value is `{plugin_name: class}`.

Key behaviours:

- Passing `None` iterates **all four** entry-point groups and merges the results.
- Passing a string (e.g. `"hivemind.database"`) is also accepted.
- If a plugin's `load()` raises, the error is logged once and the entry point is skipped;
  the dict simply will not contain that name. This is the **error-swallowing** behaviour
  described in [Advanced](advanced.md).
- Already-errored entry points are tracked in `find_plugins._errored` to prevent log spam
  on repeated calls.

---

## Factories

Each plugin type has a corresponding factory with two class methods:

| Factory | `get_class(name)` returns | `create(name, ...)` returns |
|---|---|---|
| `DatabaseFactory` | `Type[AbstractDB]` | `AbstractDB` or `AbstractRemoteDB` |
| `AgentProtocolFactory` | `Type[AgentProtocol]` | `AgentProtocol` |
| `NetworkProtocolFactory` | `Type[NetworkProtocol]` | `NetworkProtocol` |
| `BinaryDataHandlerProtocolFactory` | `Type[BinaryDataHandlerProtocol]` | `BinaryDataHandlerProtocol` |
| `PolicyPluginFactory` | `Type[PolicyPlugin]` | `PolicyPlugin` |

Source: `hivemind_plugin_manager/__init__.py:21–115`

`get_class` raises `KeyError` with a helpful message listing available plugins when the
requested name is not installed. `create` calls `get_class` then instantiates with the
appropriate kwargs.

### DatabaseFactory routing

`DatabaseFactory.create` checks whether the resolved class is a subclass of
`AbstractRemoteDB`. If it is, `host` and `port` are forwarded. If not, they are dropped.
This means callers can always pass all parameters safely.

```python
if issubclass(plugin, AbstractRemoteDB):
    return plugin(name=name, subfolder=subfolder, password=password, host=host, port=port)
return plugin(name=name, subfolder=subfolder, password=password)
```

Source: `hivemind_plugin_manager/__init__.py:33`

---

## Plugin Lifecycle

A plugin class is loaded once when `find_plugins()` is called. Factories instantiate a new
object per `create()` call. There is no HPM-managed teardown; cleanup is the plugin's
responsibility (e.g. close database connections in `__del__` or an explicit `close()` method
if the implementation adds one).

---

## The `Client` Dataclass

`Client` is the core data model — it represents a device or credential authorised to connect
to a HiveMind node.

```python
@dataclass
class Client:
    client_id: int
    api_key: str
    name: str = ""
    description: str = ""
    is_admin: bool = False
    last_seen: float = -1
    allowed_types: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)  # admission whitelist; empty = deny everything
    crypto_key: Optional[str] = None
    password: Optional[str] = None
    can_broadcast: bool = True
    can_escalate: bool = True
    can_propagate: bool = True
    metadata: Dict[str, Any] = field(default_factory=dict)
```

Source: `hivemind_plugin_manager/database.py:35`

Notable rules enforced in `__post_init__` (`database.py:56`):

- `client_id` must be `int` — raises `ValueError` otherwise.
- `is_admin` must be `bool` — raises `ValueError` otherwise.
- `allowed_types` is **not** pre-populated. An empty list means the client cannot inject
  any message type (deny-by-default). Operators grant access explicitly via
  `hivemind-core allow-msg <type> <id>` or by passing `allowed_types=[...]` on
  construction. See [HiveMind-core#85](https://github.com/JarbasHiveMind/HiveMind-core/issues/85).

`skill_blacklist` and `intent_blacklist` are **deprecated property shims** (`database.py:86`,
`database.py:102`) that read and write `Client.metadata["skill_blacklist"]` /
`Client.metadata["intent_blacklist"]` transparently. Setting them emits
`DeprecationWarning`. `message_blacklist` was removed outright — it was introduced
2024-12-20 alongside legitimate ACL work but contradicted the deny-by-default whitelist
model and never functioned as a real gate. No property, no kwarg, no carry-forward.

**Legacy constructor kwargs** (`skill_blacklist`, `intent_blacklist`) are accepted via a
wrapped `__init__` (`database.py:249`) and auto-migrated into `metadata` with a
`DeprecationWarning`. `Client(message_blacklist=...)` raises `TypeError`.

### `metadata` — plugin-specific extension point

`metadata` is a free-form dict that plugins can use to attach arbitrary per-client
context (routing hints, auth metadata, feature flags, telemetry tags, etc.) without
adding new top-level fields to the core dataclass.

`Client.deserialize` (`database.py:135`) is forward-compatible with older records in two
ways:

- **Legacy blacklist fields** (`skill_blacklist`, `intent_blacklist`) found as top-level
  JSON keys are silently migrated into `metadata` with a `DeprecationWarning`, so
  existing on-disk JSON databases keep loading without manual migration. Source:
  `database.py:153`. **`message_blacklist`** top-level keys are dropped silently — the
  field is gone for good and the data is not carried forward.
- **Any other unknown top-level key** is folded into `metadata` so plugin-added fields
  do not break deserialization. Explicit `metadata` dict entries win on collision.

A non-dict `metadata` value in `__post_init__` is coerced to `{}` (`database.py:70`),
signalling an upstream serializer bug via a missing-key outcome rather than a crash.

---

## Database Schema Migration

`AbstractDB` declares a `SCHEMA_VERSION: ClassVar[int]` constant (currently
`2`) and a non-abstract `migrate(self, from_version: int)` hook
(`database.py:368`). The default implementation is a no-op; backends opt in
by overriding it.

**Contract for backend authors:**

1. Persist the current schema version somewhere backend-native — `PRAGMA
   user_version` for SQLite, a sentinel key (`hivemind:schema_version`) for
   Redis, a top-level `__schema_version__` field for JSON files, etc.
2. At backend init (typically `__post_init__`), read the persisted version;
   if it is lower than `AbstractDB.SCHEMA_VERSION`, call
   `self.migrate(from_version=stored)` and then write the new version.
3. `migrate()` MUST be **idempotent and crash-safe**. A partial migration
   interrupted by a crash must produce the same final state when re-run.

**Migration matrix:**

| from → to | What the backend must do |
|---|---|
| `1 → 2` | Move legacy top-level OVOS blacklist fields (`skill_blacklist`, `intent_blacklist`) into each `Client.metadata` dict (`setdefault` — never clobber an explicit metadata value), then drop the legacy storage. **`message_blacklist`** is dropped without carry-forward (the field was removed from the data model entirely; backends MAY still persist it in `metadata` if they like, but it is no longer a load-bearing key). |

The legacy field names map 1:1 to keys under `metadata` — this is what the
`Client.skill_blacklist` etc. property shims read from
(`database.py:87`–`140`).

Existing third-party backends that don't override `migrate()` continue to
work — they just won't clean up legacy on-disk shape. The
`@property` shims on `Client` ensure read-path code keeps functioning
regardless of whether migration has run.

## `_SubProtocol` Base

All three protocol base classes (`AgentProtocol`, `NetworkProtocol`,
`BinaryDataHandlerProtocol`) inherit from `_SubProtocol` (`protocols.py:35`), which
provides three convenience properties:

| Property | Returns when `hm_protocol` is set | Returns when not set |
|---|---|---|
| `identity` | `hm_protocol.identity` (`NodeIdentity`) | fresh `NodeIdentity()` |
| `database` | `hm_protocol.db` | `None` |
| `clients` | `hm_protocol.clients` (dict) | `{}` |

Source: `hivemind_plugin_manager/protocols.py:35`

`hm_protocol` is a forward reference to `HiveMindListenerProtocol` (from `hivemind-core`).
It is `None` during unit tests and during construction when the protocol is passed as a
constructor argument to `HiveMindListenerProtocol` (which assigns `self` back afterward).
